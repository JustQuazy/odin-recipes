    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 red bell or pointed pepeprs</li>
            <li>1 yelllow union</li>
            <li>5 sun dried tomatoes jarred</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves peeled and whole</li>
            <li>1 squeeze lemon juice</li>
            <li>2.5 cups vegetable stock</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to season</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoon homemade pest</li>
            <li>creme fraiche for topping</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 200Â°C</li>
            <li>Roughly chop the red peppers and place in a large baking tray with peeled whole garlic cloves. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper then roast in the oven until slightly charred (around 40 minutes).</li>
            <li>Finely chop a white onion and saute in a large pot with a little olive oil until translucent and soft. Once soft, add the roasted peppers and garlic, sun dried tomatoes and vegetable stock.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 10 minutes then turn off the heat and blend until completely smooth using an immersion blender. Taste for seasoning, I only add pepper because there's enough saltiness from the stock and sun dried tomatoes and pre seasoned peppers.</li>
            <li>Add a small splash of freshly squeezed lemon juice, stir and serve with a drizzle of creme fraiche and homemade pesto. Grab a hunk of crusty bread and dive in.</li>
        </ol>
